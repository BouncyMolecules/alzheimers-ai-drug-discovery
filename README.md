# 🧠 AI-Powered Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Platform

> *"What was once mocked is now built" - An AI-driven approach to accelerating Alzheimer's drug discovery*

## 🚀 Overview

This platform uses artificial intelligence to generate novel therapeutic candidates for Alzheimer's disease by learning from existing drugs and their chemical patterns.

## ✨ Features

- **🧬 Molecular Generation**: AI creates novel drug candidates using LSTM neural networks
- **📊 Property Analysis**: Automatic evaluation of drug-like properties (Lipinski's Rule of Five)
- **🔬 3D Visualization**: Interactive molecular structure viewing
- **🏥 Alzheimer's Focus**: Trained specifically on Alzheimer's drug compounds
- **🌐 Web Interface**: Beautiful Streamlit dashboard for easy interaction

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **AI/ML**: PyTorch, LSTM Neural Networks
- **Cheminformatics**: RDKit
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit
- **Visualization**: py3Dmol, Matplotlib
- **Data**: Pandas, NumPy
